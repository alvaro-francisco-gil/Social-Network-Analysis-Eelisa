# Social-Network-Analysis-Presentation
The objective of this Data Analysis Project is to explore a research community through their email interactions, aiming to derive insights that can enhance Collaboration and raise Awareness.

## Description

This research project was carried out from September to December 2022 through a grant awarded to me by Technical University of Madrid (UPM). The project directors were Dr Peter Gloor (MiT) and Dr Juan Garbajosa (UPM). I was in charge of data collection, cleaning, processing and presentation of results.
